# üöÄ Vite + TS + Tailwind + shadcn/ui Template

## What's this?

A no-nonsense template for when you need to slap a Claude-generated UI somewhere that isn't a chat window.

Uses the exact same UI stack as [Claude Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them), for copy-pasting:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for speed
- TypeScript for sanity
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for style
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for pretty buttons
- File-based routing because ain't nobody got time for that
- My personal Tailwind color scheme and font choices, because I have opinions

## Why use it?

Because you're tired of setting up the same stack for the 100th time. This template is for the "I just want it to work" crowd.

## Quick Start

1. Use this template:

   - Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub
   - Choose "Create a new repository"
   - Give it a snazzy name and hit "Create repository from template"

2. Clone your new repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-snazzy-new-repo.git
   cd your-snazzy-new-repo
   ```

3. Install dependencies (go grab a coffee, it'll take a minute):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Run it:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Add a page:

   - Throw a new `.tsx` file in `src/pages`
   - Magic! It's now a route. (Thanks, [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages))

6. Build for production:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

7. Deploy:
   - Take the `dist` folder
   - Throw it at a static host (Nginx, Netlify, whatever floats your boat)
   - Profit!

## "But how do I...?"

- Customize theme? `tailwind.config.js` is your friend. (But my color choices are pretty rad, just saying.)
- Add shadcn/ui components? `npx shadcn-ui add <component-name>`. Done.
- Need more? Check out the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/), [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), or [shadcn/ui docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
